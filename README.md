# Hi there 👨‍💻, {Siddhartha here}. 


## &nbsp;***About me***

I am currently a student at Vellore Institute of Technology, Bhopal, pursuing B.Tech in Electronics and Communication. From learning core concepts of ECE to exploring programming languages like Javascript, java, and Shell, I like to learn and explore something new, productive, and creative.
